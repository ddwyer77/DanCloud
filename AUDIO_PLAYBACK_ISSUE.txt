AUDIO PLAYBACK ISSUE - DANCLOUD MUSIC STREAMING APP
=====================================================

## APP OVERVIEW
I'm building a music streaming app called "DanCloud" using:
- Frontend: React Native with Expo
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- Audio: expo-av library (deprecated, but currently in use)
- Navigation: React Navigation with bottom tabs
- Architecture: Context-based state management for audio player

## CURRENT PROBLEM
**Audio files won't play - they upload successfully but have 0 bytes of data**

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### App Structure:
```
App.tsx
├── AuthProvider
├── NavigationContainer
    └── AudioPlayerProvider
        └── AppNavigator (Feed, Upload, Notifications, Profile tabs)
```

### Key Components:
1. AudioPlayerContext (src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx) - Manages audio playback state
2. TrackService (src/services/trackService.ts) - Handles file uploads to Supabase storage
3. UploadScreen (src/screens/UploadScreen.tsx) - File selection with DocumentPicker
4. TrackDetailScreen - Where play button is pressed

## DEBUGGING RESULTS

### Upload Process (Working):
- Files are selected correctly via DocumentPicker
- Upload to Supabase storage succeeds
- Database records are created properly
- URLs are generated correctly

### Audio Playback (Failing):
```
LOG  === AUDIO PLAYBACK DEBUG ===
LOG  Track title: only hearsay
LOG  Track URL: https://wwwqwfbygmuiwkwqsajb.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/tracks/d41c9925-6479-4941-820e-1386bdcb308a-1749792488743.mp3
LOG  URL test response status: 200
LOG  URL test response headers: {"content-length": "0", "content-type": "audio/mpeg"}
ERROR Sound creation timeout
```

### Root Cause Identified:
- Audio URLs are accessible (200 status)
- BUT files have "content-length": "0" (empty files)
- Audio.Sound.createAsync() times out because there's no audio data

## UPLOAD CODE STRUCTURE
```typescript
// In trackService.ts
const audioResponse = await fetch(trackData.audioFile.uri);
const audioBlob = await audioResponse.blob();
await supabase.storage.from('audio').upload(audioPath, audioBlob);
```

### File Selection Code:
```typescript
// In UploadScreen.tsx
const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
  type: ['audio/mpeg', 'audio/wav', 'audio/mp3'],
  copyToCacheDirectory: true,
});
```

## WHAT WE NEED TO FIX
1. **Why are audio files being uploaded as 0 bytes?** The upload process appears to work but results in empty files
2. **Is the blob conversion failing?** The fetch → blob conversion might not be working properly
3. **Are there permission issues?** File access might be restricted
4. **Is DocumentPicker providing invalid URIs?** The selected file URIs might not be accessible

## CURRENT STATUS
- App functionality is otherwise complete (auth, database, UI all working)
- Only audio playback is broken due to empty file uploads
- Need to debug the upload process to ensure files contain actual audio data
- May need to switch from expo-av to expo-audio (as expo-av is deprecated)

## FILES TO FOCUS ON
- src/services/trackService.ts (upload logic)
- src/contexts/AudioPlayerContext.tsx (playback logic)  
- src/screens/UploadScreen.tsx (file selection)

## EXPECTED OUTCOME
Users should be able to upload MP3 files and play them back with audio controls working properly.

```

## KEY OBSERVATION
The critical issue is in the response headers:
- "content-length": "0" - This means the file is completely empty
- "content-type": "audio/mpeg" - The file type is correct
- Status 200 - The file exists and is accessible

This confirms that files are being uploaded to Supabase storage but they contain no actual audio data (0 bytes).

## NEXT STEPS NEEDED
1. Add debugging to the upload process to see blob size before upload
2. Test if DocumentPicker is providing valid file URIs
3. Verify if the fetch() call on the local file URI is working
4. Consider switching to expo-audio from deprecated expo-av
5. Test with different audio file formats and sources

## DEBUGGING CODE ADDED
Upload debugging has been added to trackService.ts:
```typescript
console.log('=== UPLOAD DEBUG ===');
console.log('Audio file URI:', trackData.audioFile.uri);
console.log('Audio file name:', trackData.audioFile.name);
console.log('Audio file type:', trackData.audioFile.type);

const audioResponse = await fetch(trackData.audioFile.uri);
console.log('Fetch response status:', audioResponse.status);
console.log('Fetch response headers:', Object.fromEntries(audioResponse.headers.entries()));

const audioBlob = await audioResponse.blob();
console.log('Blob size:', audioBlob.size);
console.log('Blob type:', audioBlob.type);
console.log('=== END UPLOAD DEBUG ===');
```

This will help identify exactly where in the upload process the file data is being lost.
